//! Configuration table services for Patina components.
//!
//! [`ConfigurationTableServices`] exposes UEFI configuration table installation and lookup. The
//! trait is object-safe and works with the opaque [`ConfigTablePtr`] token.
//!
//! Configuration tables associate a GUID with a pointer to a vendor-defined table (for example
//! ACPI or SMBIOS tables). The UEFI Specification allows at most one table per GUID.
//!
//! Component authors should install and retrieve fixed-size tables through
//! [`ConfigurationTableServicesExt`] rather than using [`ConfigurationTableServices`] directly.
//!
//! Implement [`ConfigTable`] to bind a GUID to a concrete Rust type, then use
//! [`ConfigurationTableServicesExt::install`] (or [`ConfigurationTableServicesExt::install_or_replace`]
//! for a table that is republished, such as after each record added to it) and [`ConfigurationTableServicesExt::get`].
//!
//! Once installed, a table's address is accessible by any other code with access to the UEFI system table,
//! including other components, `extern "efiapi"` callers, and later boot phases, so [`ConfigurationTableServicesExt::get`]
//! and [`ConfigurationTableServicesExt::get_bytes`] copy the table's current contents out rather than returning a
//! reference into it. This is to avoid creating a `&'static` reference, which would assert that nothing mutates
//! the table for as long as the reference might still be used, which cannot be upheld by this code. Neither method
//! exposes a raw pointer to the caller, and both verify (at runtime) that a lookup's requested type matches the
//! type the table was installed with, so [`ConfigurationTableServicesExt::get`] is not `unsafe`.
//!
//! [`ConfigTable`] still requires a fixed-size Rust type, but that type may be a self-describing
//! header for a table with trailing variable-length data. Override [`ConfigTable::table_len`] to report
//! the table's real, total size, and read the whole table (header plus trailing data) with
//! [`ConfigurationTableServicesExt::get_bytes`]. Tables that cannot be represented as a single Rust
//! type at all, because their total size depends on data assembled outside of Patina's control,
//! can fall back to using the `unsafe` [`ConfigurationTableServices::install_table`] with a raw
//! [`ConfigTablePtr`].
//!
//! Callers that need zero-copy access to the active table, and are willing to take on the resulting aliasing
//! requirements themselves, can use [`ConfigurationTableServicesExt::get_ptr`] instead. It returns a
//! type-verified, non-owning [`NonNull`] rather than a reference, so no aliasing assertions are made.
