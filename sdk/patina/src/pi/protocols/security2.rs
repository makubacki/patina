//! Security2 Architectural Protocol
//!
//! Abstracts security-specific functions from the DXE Foundation of UEFI Image Verification, Trusted Computing Group
//! (TCG) measured boot, and User Identity policy for image loading and consoles. This protocol must be produced by a
//! boot service or runtime DXE driver.
//!
//! This protocol is optional and must be published prior to the EFI_SECURITY_ARCH_PROTOCOL. As a result, the same
//! driver must publish both of these interfaces.
//!
//! When both Security and Security2 Architectural Protocols are published, LoadImage must use them in accordance with
//! the following rules:
//! - The Security2 protocol must be used on every image being loaded.
//! - The Security protocol must be used after the Security2 protocol and only on images that have been read using
//!   Firmware Volume protocol.
//! - When only Security architectural protocol is published, LoadImage must use it on every image being loaded.
//!

/// This service abstracts the invocation of Trusted Computing Group (TCG) measured boot, UEFI
/// Secure boot, and UEFI User Identity infrastructure. For the former two, the DXE Foundation
/// invokes the FileAuthentication() with a DevicePath and corresponding image in
/// FileBuffer memory. The TCG measurement code will record the FileBuffer contents into the
/// appropriate PCR. The image verification logic will confirm the integrity and provenance of the
/// image in FileBuffer of length FileSize . The origin of the image will be DevicePath in
/// these cases.
/// If the FileBuffer is NULL, the interface will determine if the DevicePath can be connected
/// in order to support the User Identification policy.
