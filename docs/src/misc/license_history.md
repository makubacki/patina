# License History

This file contains the history of Patina license changes.

## Key Dates

* Project Inception: BSD-2-Clause-Patent License

  The project was initially licensed under the BSD-2-Clause-Patent license. This license met the overall
  license requirements for the project itself and was a natural starting point as it is used by C code
  ported to and referenced by the project.

* September 4, 2025: Change to Apache-2.0 License

  The project license was changed from BSD-2-Clause-Patent to Apache-2.0. This change was made to better
  align with the Rust ecosystem and to provide additional protections and clarity for contributors and users.

  The change was made following the guidelines set forth in the project's governance documentation approved in
  [RFC: Apache 2.0 License for Patina](https://github.com/OpenDevicePartnership/governance/blob/main/rfc/0013-patina-apache-20-license.md).
